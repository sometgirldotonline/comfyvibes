Simple musicplayer app using youtube embeds. Supports playlists and Albums from YouTube or YouTube music. There is lyric support using LRCLib.
Hover over the phone in the bottom right of the screen to control the player. YouTubes iframe api SUCKS and sometimes playlists must be clicked more than once to actually play. Also some songs may have restrictions placed by the creator that blocks embedding. I plan to rewrite this to use Invidious as the backend to get around this and hopefully have an easier time with the embedding.
This app is hilariously jank, using a lot of scraping because i did not want to use an API Key and have a whole backend to hide it.
